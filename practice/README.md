## Setting up juptyer and anacoda on WSL(Windows Subsytem for Linux)
Since I'm using ubuntu on windows, I couldn't just download it to windows and start using jupyter from the ubuntu terminal.
So I used this tutorial to install:

<b>But</b> make sure to use:
```
bash Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
after the wget command. Otherwise, you never get the prompt to install
