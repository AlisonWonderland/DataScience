# Week 2

Repo where I store files from this coursera course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-statistics-financial-analysis/

Will be using these files as reference for later work

## What I learned from this week
* Learned some statistics terms like distibution and random variables
* sample() takes n random items from our dataframe. We can append this with other functions like sum().
* value_counts() counts the number of times a value shows up in a df. Used to find the frequency of a value
