# Week 1 

Repo where I store files from this coursera course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-statistics-financial-analysis/

Will be using these files as reference for later work

## What I learned from this week
*  I learned about functions/methods that are used to obtain and print a certain number of rows from our DataFrame object.
* Learned that you can index a DataFrame column using dfName['column']. Useful when you only want the rows from that column by combining with the loc() or iloc methods
* You can create a new column by doing dfName['new column name'] = something.
